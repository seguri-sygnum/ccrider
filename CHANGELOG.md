# Changelog

## [0.9.8] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- **Session recovery mode** - when a session file has been deleted by Claude Code but CCRider still has the conversation indexed, CCRider can start a new session with context from the old one. Prompts user to confirm, checks for CCRider MCP server, and falls back to asking for directory if original paths don't exist.

## [0.9.7] - 2025-01-11

### Fixed

- **project_path not updating on re-import** - sessions imported with wrong project_path (e.g., worktree path instead of main repo) were stuck forever because `ON CONFLICT` didn't update project_path. Now always updates from first message CWD.
- **Date filter comparison** - fixed timestamp format mismatch that caused date filters to fail

### Added

- **`sync --force` flag** - re-imports all sessions regardless of mtime, fixing any stale project_path values
- **CLI date filters** - CLI search now supports same filters as TUI: `after:`, `before:`, `date:`, `project:`

### Changed

- **Centralized filter parsing** - date/project filters moved to core, shared by TUI and CLI
- Supported date formats:
  - Go duration: `after:3h`, `after:24h`, `after:168h` (hours ago)
  - Natural language: `after:yesterday`, `after:tomorrow`, `before:today`
  - Relative: `after:3-days-ago`, `before:last-week`
  - ISO 8601: `after:2024-01-15`, `before:2024-01-15T10:30:00`

## [0.9.6] - 2025-01-08

### Added

- Anchor phrase retry increased for better reliability

## [0.9.5] - 2025-01-04

### Added

- **MCP: generate_session_anchor tool** - generates a unique diceware phrase Claude says aloud to "tag" its session, then searches with anchor_phrase to find earlier context that disappeared due to context compaction
- Anchor phrase search now retries up to 3 times with 500ms delays to handle Claude Code write buffering

### Removed

- **MCP: get_session_detail tool** - redundant with search_sessions + get_session_messages

## [0.9.4] - 2025-01-04

### Added

- **MCP: anchor_phrase for finding current session** - Claude can now search earlier in its own conversation by providing a unique phrase it just said/saw as an anchor. Defaults to last hour for best accuracy.
- **MCP: exact_match parameter** - auto-quotes the query for exact phrase matching (no more Claude failing to quote)

## [0.9.3] - 2025-01-04

### Fixed

- **Search race condition** - fast typing no longer shows stale results
  - Previously: typing "hello" quickly could show results for "hell" if that search completed last
  - Now: sequence numbers ensure only the most recent search results are displayed

## [0.9.2] - 2025-01-01

### Fixed

- **FTS5 search now handles all special characters** - queries with commas, hyphens, @, #, and other punctuation no longer cause syntax errors
  - Previously: `"4 tests, 0 failures"` → FTS5 syntax error
  - Now: properly escaped and searched
- Implemented proper FTS5 query escaping (same approach as sqlite-utils/datasette)
- Removed LIKE fallback for special characters - all searches now use FTS5 with proper escaping
- Preserved wildcard search functionality (`handle*` still works)

## [0.9.1] - 2024-12-30

### Fixed

- Phrase search now works in TUI (quotes were being stripped)
- Auto-balance quotes during live typing to prevent FTS5 errors
- Restored Elvis video to README hero position

## [0.9.0] - 2024-12-30

### Added

- **Anthropic API support** for session summarization as alternative to AWS Bedrock
  - Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to use direct API instead of Bedrock
- **Filter-only search** - search by date/project without requiring text query
  - `after:yesterday`, `before:2024-11-01`, `project:myapp` work standalone
- **SQLite busy timeout** - 5 second retry on database locks during concurrent access
- Message count and last working directory in CLI search output

### Fixed

- Date filter parsing: `2024-11-01` no longer misinterpreted as time "11:01"
- Hyphenated date filters now work: `3-days-ago`, `last-week`
- TUI search view overflow - header no longer disappears with many results
- Summary and project path truncation in TUI to prevent text spilling off screen
- Skip sessions with fewer than 5 messages during summarization

### Changed

- Improved summarization prompts for better problem-solution focus
- CLI search output format now matches TUI (relative time, message count, shorter paths)
